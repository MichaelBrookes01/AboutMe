-  Hello I'm Michael. I am a data analyst looking for a role to gain experience and new skills.
-  I’m interested in learning new skills to complement my knowledge in Excel, Power bi, and Python.
-  I’m currently learning Tableau and data visualisation.
-  I'm looking to work on any project to gain more knowledge around data and how to use it effectively. 
-  Feel free to contact me by email at mikebrookes01@gmail.com.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to re-read "The lord of the rings" at least once a year and re-watch it at least three times.
